# spm
### Simple Package Manager

---

## How simple is sspm? 
#### spm is arguably too simple, and that's the point.
The intended design is to be brutally simple

## Why no options?
#### Options add clutter. 
All you do is add what packages  you want to install, and they can be installed.
- Installing a package: `sudo spm install <package>`
- Removing a package: `sudo spm remove <package>`

## Why does sspm just auto install the package?
#### Because it adds an extra step, which isn't super simple.
In the unlikelyness of something needing to be configurd.

## Why no dependency checking?
Actually, this one is a personal pet peeve of the [SSPM project's maintainer](https://github.com/SuperSimplePackageManager/SSPM):
#### WHO THE HELL DECIDED THAT DEPENDENCIES ARE COMPILED ** ~ SEPERATELY ~ ** FROM THE PROGRAM!?
If your program needs C libraries, well then that's your problem! 
- Should have your make file deal with it, or make a makefile that uses sspm to download dependencies.
  - We won't clutter the  package manager with a billion libraries. 

Or as Linus Thorvalds said:
#### ["WE DO NOT BREAK USERSPACE!"](https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/12/23/75)
- Which is something Glibc constantly violates and which is why it's absolutely trash for every CCSS!

## Why no MD5 / signature checking?
#### Who needs checksums or signatures? Everything is super reliable!
- That was sarcasm, truth is I didn't feel like adding it in yet.

## Is this really the most simple?
Probably not, as [SSPM](https://github.com/SuperSimplePackageManager/SSPM) will likely be simpler, and is the source that has been forked here.
